Required:
- Contributions go to `develop` rather than `main` or `master`

Appreciated:
- 4 spaces indentation
- `if (...) { single_statement(); }` always with braces
- `function() {` with the brace on the same line
- `//` comments everywhere
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html for the rest
