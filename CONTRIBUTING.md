Required:

- Contributions go to `develop` rather than `main` or `master`

Appreciated:

- 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Braces even for `if (...) { single_statement(); }`
- Everything else follows https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html

We also accept patches by email, repos outside github, etc.
